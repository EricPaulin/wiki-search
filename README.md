### [What is wiki4u?]
wiki4u is a responsive Wikipedia article finder coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its UI takes inspiration from early computers and their terminal. The site allows user to seach any word and find its correlating Wikipeadia article along with any related searches. Users can also choose to randomly generate a search and its related topics as well. Upon loading the searches, the site displays the number of results, a blurb for each result, and a link to the Wikipeadia article if users wish to learn more. The site also features a little ASCII mascot named MIPS the rabbit who provides some dialogue when hovered on or clicked on.

### [Challenges & Solutions]
I made this project to try to get back into web development. At the time I was very rusty so believed this project would be a good way to brush up on fundamentals such as HTML syntax, CSS styling, simple JavaScript, and handling APIs. I also wanted the UI to have a strong aeshtetic and was watching a ton of coding videos, so thought it would be fun to make the site in the style of old displays and terminals you associate with the early era coders. This meant a lot of research into how to mimic that style and apply it with modern CSS. I think it came out good in the end. Making the site responsive was also a challenge, but after a lot of testing with Google's Inspect mode, I was able to find a nice middle ground of what would look good on various devices.
