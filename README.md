### [What is wiki4u?]
wiki4u is a Wikipedia clone coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It takes inspiration from the early computer UI and terminal view. The site allows user to seach any word and find its correlating Wikipeadia article along with any related searches. Users can also choose to randomly generate a search and its related topics as well. Upon loading the searches, the site displays the number of results, a blurb for each result, and a link to the Wikipeadia article if users wish to learn more. The site also features a little ASCII mascot helper named MIPS the rabbit who is just a silly little guy.
