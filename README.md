wiki4u [v2.1]

Wikipedia Clone App I made for fun and to relearn web development fundamentals (APIs, Responsive Design, JavaScript) and apply UX Design skills learned.
I wanted to make a clean and simple design and added a little ASCII helper because it seemed like a fun way to help navigate users who may be confused.
The aesthetic for the sitecame from my love of how computer UI looked in the 1980s. I thought it would be fun to recreate, and it fit will with my little mascot.
